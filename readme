Features and Tweaks For Improvement

As the AHT crew are going to visit other cities in East Africa i would recommend the following tweaks and features for this web app in the subsequent hackathons

=> A database configuration interface for setting up the database name and table. Currently the database is hardcoded on the db.inc.php folder.
=> The base domain name is also hardcoded to www.samphiltech.com. it should be optional for a user to use his/her domain name or something alse shorter
=> currently these app is unsing the old (about to be deprcated)  mysql functions to make db calls. this should be changed to either mysqli or PDO    
   functions
=>The overall design (look and feel) of the web app should also be improved.
